## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-arbitrum-foundation/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).



_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._
- It is always assumed that at least 1 honest validator would be actively participating in the rollup protocol.
- It is known that gas spending are not reimbursed in protocol at the moment, and an adversary can force the honest validators to collectively spend more than the adversary stake due to elevated gas price.
- It is assumed that off-chain computation costs are negligible, and honest validators can react to malicious action broadcasted on-chain immediately in the same block unless the malicious party spend their censorship budget.
- It is assumed that honest validators can collectively stake as much as the attackers willing to spend.
- It is assumed that the stake token would NOT be fee-on-transfer, rebasing, have a transfer hook or otherwise have non-standard ERC20 logics.
- The resolution of challenges that do not involve honest claims are out of scope unless they lead to incorrect assertions being confirmed
- Issues within One Step Proof contracts are out of scope in this contest, but might qualify for our immunefi bug bounty.
- We assume that an adversary can censor transactions for at most 1 `challengePeriodBlocks` or `confirmPeriodBlock` (whichever is smaller)
- Compromised keys are out of scope
- Centralization risk is out-of-scope
- Example: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-arbitrum?tab=readme-ov-file#known-risks
- Any issues whose root cause exists in nitro-contracts@xxxxxx is considered out of scope but may be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/arbitrum/).

# Additional context

## Main invariants

- Challenges cannot bypass the grace period, challenges must take at least one `challengePeriodBlocks + challengeGracePeriodBlocks`
- Assertions cannot be confirmed before `confirmPeriodBlocks` after creation
- Honest assertions / layer zero edges are always confirmed under the BoLD paper’s assumptions within 2 challenge periods.
    - plus the security council grace period for assertions
- Edge ID’s and Assertion ID’s must be unique

✅ SCOUTS: Please format the response above 👆 so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
- Assuming there is at least one honest participant, no incorrect assertions or edges can be confirmed.
- Honest parties can always retrieve their assertion stakes and challenge bonds
- History commitments and their proofs can’t be manipulated somehow.
- Issues that the security council could fix during the grace period are still in scope if they are the result of an incorrect resolution of the challenge protocol.


✅ SCOUTS: Please format the response above 👆 so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

`excessStakeReceiver` will be set to a DAO controlled address. Used to reimburse honest validators.

There is a “grace period” after assertions are confirmed via challenge. This is to ensure the result of the challenge is widely observable before it causes an assertion to be confirmed. The security council can act within this grace period in the event a bad assertion is confirmed.
