Not sure what you meant by “also” but why would an audit of dispute protocol not cover its resolution haha

It’s in scope.


[05/10/2024 20:37] haxatron1
- The resolution of challenges that do not involve honest claims are out of scope unless they lead to incorrect assertions being confirmed

I havent looked into detail yet


[05/10/2024 20:38] gzeon
That exclusion is specific to challenge without an honest party participating


[05/10/2024 20:41] gzeon
Having an honest participant is the assumption for an Optimistic protocol to work

you have to use  ``yarn``, forge install is useless because all the libs are in node_modules

[05/11/2024 14:45] uaarrr
so you use linux in this case, install the yarn on the linux

some inherited contracts are OOS, but the top level contracts are not
this is the case for AdminFallbackProxy, as RollupProxy is in scope
is this intended?

[05/13/2024 08:40] umar_23269
can anyone explain bisection of a node as in BOLD whitepaper


[05/13/2024 08:53] .satyam_
this could help,
 Imagine you're playing a game where you have two boxes, one with a red ball and the other with a blue ball. You don't know which box contains which color, but you have a friend who can guess correctly. Your friend proposes a bisection: they'll guess the color of the ball in the middle box. If they're right, they win; if wrong, they lose. But here's the twist: they can ask you to split the middle box into two smaller boxes, and they'll guess the color of the ball in one of those smaller boxes. This process continues until they guess the color correctly. In BOLD, bisections are similar: disputes are narrowed down by splitting the claimed states into smaller, more manageable parts until the correct state is identified.

Hey @KnownFact | C4 , as this is a scaled pot, will the hunter/gatherer rewards also be scaled accordingly?


[05/14/2024 03:18] umar_23269
strating from L1 last state to possible last state of L1 are leaf of a merkle tree .so it`s  root is a assertion about L1 state

[05/14/2024 14:13] godzillaba

[05/14/2024 15:24] knownfactc4_29311
In cases where there are no Highs or Mediums found in a scaled pot, there isn't any hunter/gather rewards. Otherwise the hunter/gather reward is scaled based on the resultant pot.

[05/14/2024 19:04] raulj
Speaking of the complexity: we understand it can be overwhelming. However, it's really, really difficult to create a dispute game that can successfully defend against an attacker trying to confirm an invalid claim. A hard part is being able to defend against thousands or tens of thousands of attacks at the same time, and that's what BOLD allows Arbitrum to do

ECM::challengePeriodBlocks , that is in terms of L2 blocks, which are 4 per second, is that accurate? Or it's L1 blocks?

hi @sajeevan_58356 : It's a contract that stores a linked list of claims about executing the Arbitrum inbox. Something like:

After executing 10 inbox messages from the inbox on Ethereum, the Arbitrum L2 block hash is 0xabc...then after executing 11 inbox messages, the Arbitrum L2 block hash is 0xdef

These claims are called assertions and can be challenged by others via BOLD

on a more serios note, in the past I've seen this, i think once the contest is completed (not sure if after judging or right after contest ends), C4 allow you like a `grace period` of X days in order to certify, and if you don't get certified in time, you would loose your award. I'm not sure if this has evolved.


[05/20/2024 15:56] dontonka
@kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 should know once he is back online


[05/20/2024 15:58] kartoonjoy
There is only like a 60 day deadline to get certified once the audit ends. If you still aren't certified as of the established deadline, you'll forfeit funds.


[05/20/2024 15:58] ivi4yh3ivi
30 days after audit end date according to this message: https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1235688998480117790/1238472740638425178

[05/22/2024 05:40] dinesh11g
so it doesn't have any original contract before ?


[05/22/2024 05:49] gzeon
It is an action script to upgrade contract, it is supposed to be delegate called from the DAO L1 UpgradeExecutor which own the rollup; it does not have any original contract, it is not a upgrade of itself, it is a upgrade `ACTION` that contain the logic for the rollup owner to perfrom the upgrade

No. they (party A) are just given their bond back. But lossing party (B) gets punished and they looss their bond. No incentives for winning (for now)

ser I believe this isn't true for now. The incentives model has not been implemented yet. Honest validators are only receiving their staked bond, with no additional incentives. Incentives may be given in the future, but they will not be related to this contest. Please, Arbitrum team, correct me if I'm wrong.

[05/26/2024 04:36] zhuyingqiuhua
Assertion bonds: 3600 ETH - required from validators to bond their funds to an assertion in the eventual hopes of having that assertion be confirmed by the rollup protocol. This is a one-time bond required to be able to start posting assertions. This bond can be withdrawn once a validator’s assertion is confirmed and can alternatively be put together via a trustless bonding pool.

Challenge-bonds, per level: 555/79 ETH (UPDATED) - required from validators to open challenges against an assertion observed on Ethereum, for each level. Note that “level” corresponds to the level of granularity at which the interactive dissection game gets played over, starting at the block level, moving on to a range of WASM execution steps, and then finally to the level of a single step of execution. These values were carefully calculated to optimize for the resource ratio and gas costs in the event of an attack, as explained in Economics of Disputes in Arbitrum BOLD 19 and the BoLD whitepaper 9. This effectively means that an entity that has already put up a bond to propose an assertion does not need to put up a separate bond to challenge an invalid state assertion that they observe. These bonds can be refunded at the end of a challenge and can also alternatively be put together by the community using a trustless bonding pool.

The tool that classify QA report needs some love 😅 . My QA report was classified as `Insufficient Quality Report` while it's one of the top5 probably looking at all the QA reports, so it's stuck in Validation repo, will have raise this in PJQA.

I'm not sure any reports  have been moved to `findings` repo yet.  Give it a min


[06/05/2024 01:29] dontonka
On the contrary, they most likely all been moved I believe, the judge is progressing on the evaluation already. Anyway the fact that my report was marked as Insufficient Quality Report confirm it will not make it to the repo finding and will need to address it in PJQA, I hope this doesn't give me any disadvantage, we will see.

congrats everyone. we really need transparency about the `Hunter` and `Gatherer` calculation, as we don't wants bug as the partial feature to be present during months (or years) 😅 . Since there was only a unique Med, it feels wrong that he didn't get the Hunter.

can we see our issues


[06/14/2024 14:42] dontonka
you need SR role for that (back-stage), which is not your case, so you will need to wait for the report to be published which might takes months.


[06/14/2024 14:42] no.one7777
yeah i got it tnx
